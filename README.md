## Exploring the connectedness of websites through 3rd-party cookies


**This project's main goal is to help create a visualization to raise awareness about data tracking and privacy on the web.**

Based on the research by Abe Altaweel, Nathan Good and Chris Jay Hoofnagle, in which they performed a "Web Privacy Census" by collecting web cookies as a web crawler navigated through the top 100 through 25k sites and analyzed the distribution of several methods of tracking used by these common websites (first-party cookies, third-party cookies, HTML5 local storage, etc...). [For more on their research refer to their [paper](http://techscience.org/a/2015121502/download.pdf)]

There have not been many attempts to provide visualizations to this type of data, and the few seem not to be very efficient. An interesting example is provided in [here])(http://jots.pub/a/2015103001/images/fig1.png) ([source](http://jots.pub/a/2015103001/index.php)), for a similar study performed on mobile apps. The effort of the project will be to create more efficient visualizations for this type of data.


*This project was created by Ankit, Nina and Will for the final project of the Data Visualization course of the [MIDS](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/) program*
